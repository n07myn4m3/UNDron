WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <rst> is placed at site <P123>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <i2c0/i2c0/reset_inv_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y2>. There
   is only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker
   buffer, and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem
   exists and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <rst.PAD> allowing
   your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules
   related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
