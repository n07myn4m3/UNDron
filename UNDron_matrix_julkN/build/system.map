ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Pack:2744 - This design requires at least 528 SLICEMs for LUTRAMs. The target device has only 300 SLICEM sites. Please modify the
   logical design source to reduce the number of LUTRAMs. 
   As an alternative, please select a device with more SLICEM sites.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             319 out of   4,800    6%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
